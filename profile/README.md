### Vim’s key capabilities
* The Vim OS platform enables communication with EHRs by **identifying, reading, and sharing context**, data, and entities from the EHR such as a patient in context, an open encounter, and an order/referral being opened. 
* Certain **data elements can also be written/updated back to the EHR**, such as adding diagnosis or procedure codes to an encounter, updating a target referral, and more. 
* Learn more about this functionality in the [Vim Connectivity](https://docs.getvim.com/vim-os-js/vim-ehr-connectivity.html) and [Vim Connectivity write-back](https://docs.getvim.com/vim-os-js/vim-ehr-connectivity.html#writeback-to-ehr-resources) guides.
